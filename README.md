Assignment: CSS Hell
====================



Resources and Collaboration:

Part 1:

Consulted with Jillian Lovas CCID jlovas  

I changed the body's background into a fixed image background. I changed the margins to centre the text more. I changed the headers into the "Bookman" font. Paragraphs have indents at the beginning and margins. Images have light brown solid borders. the hr's have been stylized. The soty font has been enlarged but the less important text has been reduced in size. Links (unvisited and previously visited) are black with a blue hover.
